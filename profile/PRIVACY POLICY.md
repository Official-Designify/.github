### 2.2 Data for API Services

Our API is publicly available, and users can request data, such as:

- **Finding Roblox accounts from Discord IDs**.

  This allows users to interact with the bot and verify user identities across platforms.

- **Public API Access**: Users can access our API to request Roblox-related information based on Discord user IDs, and vice versa. This data is publicly accessible through the API for functionality purposes.

### 3.2 Third-Party Services

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

Although the data we collect is not highly sensitive, we take measures to secure it:
